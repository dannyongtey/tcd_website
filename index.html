 							 	Why the Name Change?
        		</h3>
            <p>
                If you have participated in IT Career Week before, you might be wondering the reason for the name change. It is part of rebranding IT Career Week, as we found that the term "days" better describes the event duration than "week", since the event runs for two days rather than the whole week.
